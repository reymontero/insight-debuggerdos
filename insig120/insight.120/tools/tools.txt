mkhelp
------

This program creates binary image of video page from input file.
Input file is a text file that contains 25 lines, 80 columns in
each line. Output file contains pairs char/attribute. Attributes
defined by special symbols that can be inserted in the lines of
input file:
`<' -- use COL_FRAME
`(' -- use COL_BOLD
`[' -- use COL_ITALIC
`{' -- use COL_KEY
`>', `)', `]', `}' -- use COL_TEXT again.
mkhelp uses COL_TEXT for text, that not enclosed in pairs of
these symbols. You can edit mkhelp.h to redefine colors.
Output file must have size 4000 bytes for screen 80x25. Use
chksize to check the size of output file.


chksize
-------

This program compares the size of the specified file with command
line argument (positive decimal number). If they identical,
chksize returns 0, if they different -- 3, if the file is not
found -- 2, if an error in command line -- 1.


uclpack
-------

This program used to compress binary image of video memory. It was
patched because decompressor do not understand header and other
such things in compressed data. If you want to rebuild uclpack you
need sources of UCL data compression library version 1.03, C
compiler (I tested DJGPP 2.03 and Open Watcom C 1.5) and patch (I
used GNU patch 2.5.4). Change directory to EXAMPLES, apply patch
(uclpack.dif) with command `patch -i PATH\TO\uclpack.dif', CD
to .., and rebuild UCL with command b\dos32\wc.bat (or dj2.bat,
see b\00readme.txt for details).
